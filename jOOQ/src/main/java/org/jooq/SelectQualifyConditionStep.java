/**
 * This type is used for the {@link Select}'s DSL API when selecting generic
 * {@link Record} types.
 * <p>
 * Example: <code><pre>
 * -- get all authors' first and last names, and the number
 * -- of books they've written in German, if they have written
 * -- more than five books in German in the last three years
 * -- (from 2011), and sort those authors by last names
 * -- limiting results to the second and third row
 *
 *   SELECT T_AUTHOR.FIRST_NAME, T_AUTHOR.LAST_NAME, COUNT(*)
 *     FROM T_AUTHOR
 *     JOIN T_BOOK ON T_AUTHOR.ID = T_BOOK.AUTHOR_ID
 *    WHERE T_BOOK.LANGUAGE = 'DE'
 *      AND T_BOOK.PUBLISHED > '2008-01-01'
 * GROUP BY T_AUTHOR.FIRST_NAME, T_AUTHOR.LAST_NAME
 *   HAVING COUNT(*) > 5
 * ORDER BY T_AUTHOR.LAST_NAME ASC NULLS FIRST
 *    LIMIT 2
 *   OFFSET 1
 *      FOR UPDATE
 *       OF FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME
 *       NO WAIT
 * </pre></code> Its equivalent in jOOQ <code><pre>
 * create.select(TAuthor.FIRST_NAME, TAuthor.LAST_NAME, create.count())
 *       .from(T_AUTHOR)
 *       .join(T_BOOK).on(TBook.AUTHOR_ID.equal(TAuthor.ID))
 *       .where(TBook.LANGUAGE.equal("DE"))
 *       .and(TBook.PUBLISHED.greaterThan(parseDate('2008-01-01')))
 *       .groupBy(TAuthor.FIRST_NAME, TAuthor.LAST_NAME)
 *       .having(create.count().greaterThan(5))
 *       .orderBy(TAuthor.LAST_NAME.asc().nullsFirst())
 *       .limit(2)
 *       .offset(1)
 *       .forUpdate()
 *       .of(TAuthor.FIRST_NAME, TAuthor.LAST_NAME)
 *       .noWait();
 * </pre></code> Refer to the manual for more details
 * <p>
 * <h3>Referencing <code>XYZ*Step</code> types directly from client code</h3>
 * <p>
 * It is usually not recommended to reference any <code>XYZ*Step</code> types
 * directly from client code, or assign them to local variables. When writing
 * dynamic SQL, creating a statement's components dynamically, and passing them
 * to the DSL API statically is usually a better choice. See the manual's
 * section about dynamic SQL for details: <a href=
 * "https://www.jooq.org/doc/latest/manual/sql-building/dynamic-sql">https://www.jooq.org/doc/latest/manual/sql-building/dynamic-sql</a>.
 * <p>
 * Drawbacks of referencing the <code>XYZ*Step</code> types directly:
 * <ul>
 * <li>They're operating on mutable implementations (as of jOOQ 3.x)</li>
 * <li>They're less composable and not easy to get right when dynamic SQL gets
 * complex</li>
 * <li>They're less readable</li>
 * <li>They might have binary incompatible changes between minor releases</li>
 * </ul>
